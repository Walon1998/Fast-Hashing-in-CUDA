abstract = {Measuring and reporting performance of parallel computers constitutes the basis for scientific advancement of high-performance computing (HPC). Most scientific reports show performance improvements of new techniques and are thus obliged to ensure reproducibility or at least interpretability. Our investigation of a stratified sample of 120 papers across three top conferences in the field shows that the state of the practice is lacking. For example, it is often unclear if reported improvements are deterministic or observed by chance. In addition to distilling best practices from existing work, we propose statistically sound analysis and reporting techniques and simple guidelines for experimental design in parallel computing and codify them in a portable benchmarking library. We aim to improve the standards of reporting research results and initiate a discussion in the HPC field. A wide adoption of our minimal set of rules will lead to better interpretability of performance results and improve the scientific culture in HPC.},

abstract="In this paper, we design a new hash function PARSHA-256. PARSHA-256 uses the compression function of SHA-256 along with the Sarkar-Schellenberg composition principle. As a consequence, PARSHA-256 is collision resistant if the compression function of SHA-256 is collision resistant. On the other hand, PARSHA-256 can be implemented using a binary tree of processors, resulting in a significant speed-up over SHA-256. We also show that PARSHA-256 can be efficiently implemented through concurrent programming on a single processor machine using a multithreaded approach. Experimental results on P4 running Linux show that for long messages the multithreaded implementation is faster than SHA-256.",
