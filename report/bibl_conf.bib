abstract="We formalize the notion of a proof of work (POW). In many cryptographic protocols, a prover seeks to convince a verifier that she possesses knowledge of a secret or that a certain mathematical relation holds true. By contrast, in a POW, a prover demonstrates to a verifier that she has performed a certain amount of computational work in a specified interval of time. POWs have served as the basis of a number of security protocols in the literature, but have hitherto lacked careful characterization. In this paper, we offer definitions treating the notion of a POW and related concepts.",

abstract="In this paper, we design a new hash function PARSHA-256. PARSHA-256 uses the compression function of SHA-256 along with the Sarkar-Schellenberg composition principle. As a consequence, PARSHA-256 is collision resistant if the compression function of SHA-256 is collision resistant. On the other hand, PARSHA-256 can be implemented using a binary tree of processors, resulting in a significant speed-up over SHA-256. We also show that PARSHA-256 can be efficiently implemented through concurrent programming on a single processor machine using a multithreaded approach. Experimental results on P4 running Linux show that for long messages the multithreaded implementation is faster than SHA-256.",
